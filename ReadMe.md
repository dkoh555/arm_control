# 1. Introduction
This package works with the xArm6 and EZgripper by SAKE Robotics (https://sakerobotics.com/support/) and is to be used in conjuction with both of modified repos made by me (https://github.com/dkoh555/mod_old_xarm_ros) and (https://github.com/dkoh555/gripper_control) respectively.

# 2. Installation
Make sure to install the above mentioned packages first, so you clone them into your workspace and catkin_make BEFORE you clone in this particular package and catkin_make it.
This is because of the order of the packages that catkin_make will build may do arm_controller first, but it relies on dependencies that need to first be generated by the other two packages.
